DiffBase is a Julia package that provides common utilities and test functions that are used
by various JuliaDiff packages.

If you're a user of any JuliaDiff packages, you may want to check out DiffBase's [DiffResult
API](http://www.juliadiff.org/DiffBase.jl/diffresult/), which can be used in conjunction
with other packages in order to compute multiple orders of derivatives simultaneously.
