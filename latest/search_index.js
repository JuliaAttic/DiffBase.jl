    "text": "CurrentModule = DiffBaseSupported By:ForwardDiff\nReverseDiffMany differentiation techniques can calculate primal values and multiple orders of derivatives simultaneously. In other words, there are techniques for computing f(x), âˆ‡f(x) and H(f(x)) in one fell swoop!For this purpose, DiffBase provides the DiffResult type, which can be passed to in-place differentiation methods instead of an output buffer. The method then loads all computed results into the given DiffResult, which the user can query afterwards using DiffBase's API.Here's an example of the DiffResult in action using ForwardDiff:julia> using ForwardDiff, DiffBase\n\njulia> f(x) = sum(sin, x) + prod(tan, x) * sum(sqrt, x);\n\njulia> x = rand(4);\n\n# construct a `DiffResult` with storage for a Hessian, gradient,\n# and primal value based on the type and shape of `x`.\njulia> result = DiffBase.HessianResult(x)\n\n# instead of passing an output buffer to `hessian!`, we pass `result`\njulia> ForwardDiff.hessian!(result, f, x);\n\n# ...and now we can get all the computed data from `result`\njulia> DiffBase.value(result) == f(x)\ntrue\n\njulia> DiffBase.gradient(result) == ForwardDiff.gradient(f, x)\ntrue\n\njulia> DiffBase.hessian(result) == ForwardDiff.hessian(f, x)\ntrueThe rest of this document describes the API for constructing, accessing, and mutating DiffResult instances. For details on how to use a DiffResult with a specific package's methods, please consult that package's documentation."
