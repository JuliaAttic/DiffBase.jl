# DiffBase.jl


DiffBase is a Julia package that provides common utilities and test functions that are used by various JuliaDiff packages.


If you're a user of any JuliaDiff packages, you may want to check out DiffBase's [DiffResult API](diffresult.md), which can be used in conjunction with other packages in order to compute multiple orders of derivatives simultaneously.
